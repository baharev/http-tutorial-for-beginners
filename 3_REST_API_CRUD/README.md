# Starting the server

You must install Node.js first.

 - [Install Node.js on Windows](https://youtu.be/gLHLohf2jEs)

Assuming that you have already installed Node.js,
execute the following command in the command line / PowerShell:

    npx --yes json-server --watch server.json --host 0.0.0.0

The above command must be executed in this subdirectory, that is,
in the directory where the server.json file is.
